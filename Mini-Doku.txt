Controls:
	- move ship with arrow keys
	- shoot with spacebar
	- press "p" to pause the game

Features:
	- reusable physics
	- simple bullet patterns
	- reusable GUI	
	...I think there is more to add here

To-Do:
	- make proper use of rotation
	- different enemys, also improve AI(there is no atual AI currently)
	- client/server
	- powerups/special abilities
	- bosses
	- levels(possibly jsons?)
	- sound
	- animations
	- more obvious incorporation of the factions feature

Bugs:
	- score does not count up destroyed objects for seamingly random reasons
	(possibly its the bullet collides with object works but obeject collides with bullet does not work issue again)
	- player cannot collide with enemy because user input and AI override the changes collision makes
	- once something is at the side of the screen it keeps colliding with the wall placed there and so bullets 
	start to jump again as one object can always only collide with one other object at a time
