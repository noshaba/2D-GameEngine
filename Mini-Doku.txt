Controls:
	- move ship with arrow keys up/down = up/down left/right = change direction(rotation)
	- shoot with spacebar
	- press "p" to pause the game
	- press "s" to activate shield when available

Features:
	- reusable physics
	- simple bullet patterns
	- rotation
	- reusable GUI	
	- items
	- customizable levels(jsons)
	- factions
	...I think there is more to add here

To-Do:
	- remove walls
	- different enemys, also improve AI(there is no atual AI currently)
	- bosses
	- sound
	- animations/sprites
	- more obvious incorporation of the factions feature

Bugs:
	- score does not count up destroyed objects for seemingly random reasons
	(possibly its the bullet collides with object works but object collides with bullet does not work issue again)
	- once something is at the side of the screen it keeps colliding with the wall placed there and so bullets 
	start to jump again as one object can always only collide(react to collision) with one other object at a time

JSONs:

    {
        "type": what object? Valid input currently "Enemy", "Astroid", "MeanEnemy",
